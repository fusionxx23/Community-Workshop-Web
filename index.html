                          <p>Community Workshop is a space designed to support the collaborative, entrepreneurial and
                            artistic needs of makers, hobbyists, entrepreneurs, artists, and small business owners. We
                            provide the tools, materials, space, and collaboration required to turn your idea into a finished
                            project.</p>
                            <p>  A makerspace by definition, is many things, and they each have their focus. Our focus leans
                                toward technology and how it can enhance the arts, society, and our community. We balance
                                that out with sailing, music, and laughter.</p>
                          <p>
                            We are all about shared resources. All of the tools and facilities are available for every member.
                            If you are unfamiliar with a tool or process we will make apprenticeships and training available</p>

                                Community Workshop is an inclusive space bringing people together to share resources
                                and support each other in the exploration of shared interests and development of new
                                skills.
                                Community Workshop maintains the philosophy that sharing resources increases their
                                utility and broadens the benefits that can be gained. We are focused on finding the most
                                efficient way to enable this.
